Prediciting prices for Airbnb Berlin

(see .ipynb file)


Hypothesis
The hypothesis for this is that summer time travel will be the most expensive time to travel to Berlin each year based on 2 datasets from kaggle concerning the Airbnb of Berlin. The hypothesis is, like many destinations summer will be the most expensive time to travel. This project will also show the most busy time of year to travel so as give a recommendation on when it is the most crowded. Although there are multiple variables in this dataset, the focus will be strictly on:

'entire home - 1 bedroom'
'entire home - 3 or more bedroom'
The testing will be this by labeling the seasons as follows:

dates between 2/28 - 5/31 will be spring
dates between 6/01 - 8/31 will be summer
dates between 9/01 - 11/30 will be fall
dates between 12/01 - 2/27 will be winter
